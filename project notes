requirements
-----
demostrate gaurding of routes using fastapi
routes need to be accesssible to only valid users who have the  correct roles
further the end point should return  only  the department specific data
the tables will have a column indicating if data is sensitive and should be accessible only if user has additional permissions

this is a project explorig concepts for route management.  it will be used to integrate with an existing system
this should be implemented in a way that is easy to understand and maintain
need aminimal implmentation.
key concepts in code should be annotated
demonstarate pythonic way
should fully follow best architectural  concepts and design practices
this should be having least disruption and changes to the existing system. this is critical for the project
as much as possible, the implementation should astarct this feature and itroduce it by configuration or a new component.
the existing project is already developed in a significant manner without considering teh end point accesses and uthorization.
assume that roles are provided. can create a dummy class to retuirn roles.



create the tables
choose a weel known domain
create docuemntation in a md file 
need a simple implementation to demostrate concepts with clarity and ease of understanding

come up with an approach first
create the approach and specs based upon this for review and approval before proceeding
no code is needed at this point
the expected outcome is a requirements docuemnt
