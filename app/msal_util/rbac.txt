i have a set of roles like reader, modeller, manager, Admin
modeller has all privileges that a reader has
manager has all privileges that a modeller has
admin has all privileges that manager has and some modeller

theese roles apply to end point access of a restapi backed by fastapi

the privileges for roles are kept in yaml file.

we need to load the yaml.
prase and read the privileges.

we extarct role from info in request,

based on role, we ahve to determine if a user can acees a path and method.

like GET method for /create_content

assume teh domain is realted to conent creation like documents.

the roles are hierarchical.

come up with set of privileges for roles
come up with yaml file with privileges , role wise.

to avoid duplication, the yaml has extends clauses for each role. with one role extending the other.
verify  by examining critically if this is a  good approach.
because, the role checker checks for erecursive extends and makes logic complex.

we  need a yaml loader, parser, role checker,role checker checxks based upon method(GET/POST), role and path.

thew implementation needs to be simple, pythonic, clear.

modeller:
    display_name: reader_chap
    Description:reader role
    extends:
        reader
    allow:
        -POST:/content/create
